# This wrapper script is used by the lsfscheduler to perform the following tasks:
# 1. Launch process manager daemons on the execution hosts, using a unique port
#    based on LSB_JOBID
# 2. Call mpiexec to launch MATLAB on the execution hosts
# 3. Clean up the process managers on the execution hosts
#
# The lsfscheduler object in MATLAB creates the environment variable MDCE_CMR
#
# The required environment variables will automatically be forwarded to the
# MATLAB processes. This occurs because lsgrun will forward the environment to
# the nodes where SMPD is launched, and then the MATLABs launched using mpiexec
# will inherit their environment from the SMPD process. If you adapt this
# script, you must ensure that the following environment variables are forwarded
# through to the MATLABs:
#
# - MDCE_DECODE_FUNCTION
# - MDCE_STORAGE_LOCATION
# - MDCE_STORAGE_CONSTRUCTOR
# - MDCE_JOB_LOCATION
# - LSB_JOBID
#
# All MPICH2 builds of MPIEXEC support a "-genvlist" argument, in which you may
# simply specify a comma-separated list of environment variables to forward.
